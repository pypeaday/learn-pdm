## Questions

`pdm init` asked for a python interpreter and put it in `.pdm-python`

`pdm venv` is a way to create virtual environments associated with the project... so I'm confused on the difference/distinction between the python binary referenced in `.pdm-python` and what the point of the `pdm venvs` is... it's confusing that they fit into the workflow of AFTER `pdm init` which required me to associate a python interpreter with this project in the first place
